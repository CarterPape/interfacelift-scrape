Overview
========
Interfacelift (interfacelift.com) has a daily wallpaper on the homepage. I wrote this script to get this daily image and set it as the desktop background on my computer. I couldn't use their API because the free trial is only 100 requests, so I went with web scraping. I use Beautiful Soup (which has excellent documentation) and requests (over urllib). This is my first web scraping script!
